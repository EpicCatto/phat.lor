Hey there, if you're reading  , you probably opened the link from my gift. Just wanted to let you know that I think you're a really great person and I'm glad we're friends. It's crazy that we've talked in person more than Kaopun (from my class) even though we've only known each other for a few weeks. Sorry if my gift wasn't the best, I'm a little low on cash right now. Hopefully I can get you some gift from Japan.
