## What's This Project About?

This is one of my early website projects that uses a mix of server-side (Express) and client-side JavaScript.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side Skills**: I used Express to handle data efficiently on the server side.
- **Interactive Elements**: There's client-side JavaScript to make the site more dynamic and engaging.
- **Content Management Panel**: An easy way for me to manage and update content on my site without touching the source code (private).
- **Multilingual Support**: The site is designed with multilingual support, representing the best implementation available at that time, showcasing my growth and learning in web development.
